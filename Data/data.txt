It survived a 5 feet drop on a marble flooring. Nothing happened to phone at all, not even a tiny scratch on the screen or at the back.    User Interface - Now, as i am used to this UI, it feels pretty good now. Letv has also announced next version of this UI, ie., EUI 6, so on UI part, no complaints.    Battery - Though battery life was somewhat low on initial days, but now, I get decent battery life that lasts for 1 whole day. Moreover, battery life would also be optimized with the new OTA update.    Customer Service - Haven't visited a service center as of now, but had a talk with Letv Customer Care regarding some minor software bug. Unlike other companies, Letv customer care executive was listening to the query very patiently and his response was also satisfactory.        
+ Premium build and value for money    Pros: full hd display is good..viewing angle really great.    looks premium.. no body will believe this phone costs only 11k.. because lookwise can comparable with above 20 k phones    finger print sensor 8 out of 10 times working flawelessly    i experienced no lag so far    quick charging is grt from 15 percent to 100 percent in 90 minutes    IR BLASTER supports all kind of tv but in ac blue star and o genaral support is not there. Built quality is simply awesome....full metal for 10 k is really nice.        
- Battery and camera issue    i have purchased this phone that it will be flagship phone        here are my reviews after using for 4 days        pros    1. battery charged at fast speed    2. Build quality is very good    3. display is very good        cons :    1 Battery backup is very poo, drain in in just 1 minute from 20% battery     2. Camera quality is very poor, indoor quality is very poor as compare to other competitor phone like k4 note    3. no memory card slot    4. some kind of vibration when phone is on charging mode and in hand, it is due to metal body, i think not suitable for usage while charging.        
- Heat Issue    Phone looks good Use it like toy in show case    Major problem is heating issue    -- U cannot spend more time with this phone     if you use it for long calls your ear will burn    if you want to browse more your hand will burn        Stratup idea -- make cooling pad for it put flash sale        
- Good phone but very poor Battery and Horrible Camera    I was in a dilemma whether to go for K4 Note or Le 1S and after a lot of reviews, i gave it for Le1S. I was so excited that i could book the phone in the flash sale and even more excited till the phone arrived. The phone looks extremely stylish and premium. However, am so disappointed with its Battery performance and Horrible Camera.        
- Mobile or iron box    Phone gets heats up even after 2 mins usage. Goes nearly 45 c. I am going to return this product. Total waste of time and money. Not worthy at all.        
- Worst camera quality not Recommended    I bought this phone & I was Satisfied of its design and Other Features such as fingerer Sensor lock    but I am total Dissatisfied with its camera as the picture quality is worst. Clicked Picture get Blured when I zoom it. Please guys those are photos freaks please do not buy this phone. another thing which i realized is that Comapny Gave 3GB RAm in this phone but customer will only get 1.2 GB available free memory which is too low.        
- Heating heavily and drastic charging    if we use phone 30 mins .heating the phone heavily.    look is good.    charging is not up-to the mark.    only 1 gb ram is available.        
- Not worth buying    Update 25Feb2016:    I requested for replacement option and got new letv le 1s phone. Headphone jack issue has been resolved. It seems some hardware defect in the first piece.    But still battery drain and heat is a huge problem.    Waiting for software update.        Need to mention about flipkart service. Flipkart service and follow-ups are awesome and very helpful. Definitely for flipkart service I would rate 5 but for this product still 1 or 2.        
+ Excellent Samsung ON7 Its always ON awesome device    This Mobile is budget category but fully featured.    Thinking 1.5GB ram would be adequate or not    But its more than adequate    Super-fast Delivery, hassle free exchange    Processor is good    Ram is good    Not hanging    No heating    Replaceble battery    Excellent back and front camera    Samsung on7 music excellent     4G lightning Fast    Clear bright Display    Awesome touchscreen    Battery is huge 3000 mah     Excellent UI        
+ Awesome phone at 11K!    I ordered this phone on 4-Nov & was delivered by Flipkart on 5-Nov. 5 stars for Flipkart & WS Retail for delivering on time.        Coming to the phone:    I backed up all data from my previous phone & transferred to On7 smoothly without any hitch. Was using a 32GB SD card.         
+ Just Amaaaaaaaazing!!!! So in loveeeeeee with this phone    This phone is jus worth buying. Guys go for it. I was damn confused before buying this phone as my past exp with Samsung was not that great. Everyday I was surfing and finding a new phone. When this phone was launched finally i decided to go for this one. Great configuration at this price. Phone is smooth smart n classy. Lets not go with wat others say about samsung. Buy this super budgeted phone and then decide. Great camera, owsm battery backup. No hanging and heating stuf!!         
+ Excellent phone, Super fast and good screen    I was looking to buy new phone for my wife and this is the best thing I did.She is super happy and me too :)        Here is product review.    Pro's    1) Price, yes you get really value for money deal.    2) Excellent build quality    3) Light weight compare to other bulky motorola, asus etc    4) Slim (8.2mm) thick compare to other bulky motorola, asus etc.    5) 5.5' inch LCD/TFT Full HD screen with 271ppi which is quite good, actually its really good you wont notice a difference at all.    6)3000mAh monster battery, well it will give you around 2 days of normal usage.        
- Good Phone but....    Good Phone for this price bracket but the screen is very fragile i dropped a 5 rupee coin on the screen accidentally and the whole display is cracked so if u buy this pls handle it with care and also there is no notification LED for missed calls and sms alerts         very very fragile display        
+ superb mobile at this price    As usual WS seller delivery is one day for me always. Very nice mobile.Superb look. Good battery backup. Camera quality is awesome. Screen resolution & clarity excellent. RAM is only concern. Out of 1.5 GB 350 MB left for user. Rest are mobile general features like messaging, phonebook..etc. but i will recommend to buy this mobile. SAMSUNG at this price with superb quality is worth to buy.        
- Pathetic camera    Friends listen carefully I had bought this cell day before yesterday and today morning I returned.    Reason I found the rear camera pathetic specially in dark or night pix...    As compare to this 13MP camera Grand 2 8MP is much clear n better.        So my suggestion pls don't buy this at all..        
+     Akki    Nov 8, 2015    certified buyer    Super good phone for a super cheap price    Writing this review after using the phone for 3 days. Amazingly great camera, super battery backup, excellent voice clarity, good speaker and great 5.5 inch display.         Battery lasted for 1 1/2 day on very extensive use of various apps and many calls. Though RAM is only 1.5 GB, the phone worked super fast.         Also, look wise phone looked like an expensive 30k worth rich phone though in reality it is just around 10k.         super excellent value for money!!         
+ Good Phone    Positive     Good camara quality front and rear    Video play back is awesome    large tft screen    good to handle         Negitive     Ram is low as far price is concern with compaired to other brands    Low internal Memory        
+ cheap price worthy one ...    super phone light weighted and fancy model... fast delivery by flipkart ..happy diwali to flipkart folks        
+ Lacks in few departments, but stands out in a lot !    So I had desperately been waiting for this phone since 2 months. Motorola definitely made me wait a lot. Well lets analyze this wait was worth it or not.    1) My phone is heating up like a microwave oven in 2 days use !!    2)I got my X style for 28000(after some offers), I feel its slightly overpriced(for 30000). Biggest feature which I miss about this phone is, that it lacks MOTO MAKER. Well this is something I was expecting to be there in this phone but Motorola has just not released moto maker in India. I would be happy with a price tag of 30000 had moto maker been there.        
- Good Mobile ""!!But heating issue!!"    Mobile is good in Display, Camera, running smooth.        But mainly mobile have heating issue. While taking videos, video call, surfing and playing games with in 5 minutes mobile gets heated like Microwave Oven.         Apart from this heating issue mobile is awesome.        
+ Awesome Phone!!!!    I received my moto X style last day and let me give the initial review.         Pros:        1. Excellent display even though they are not using AMOLED display. You have options in the display settings to make the display either normal or vibrant.    2. Both front and back cameras are awesome. Even the photos taken in dark places appears good.    3. Another important feature that I like to emphasize is Moto Action and Moto Voice. Using these you can use your phone hands-free.     4. Then comes TURBO CHARGING...it takes only very less time to get charged from 0% top about 50%.        
+     Anurag Singh    Oct 27, 2015    First to review    certified buyer    Brilliant phone and excellent service by flipkart!    The phone was released on 24th of October and I received it on the 26th of October. Great speedy delivery by flipkart(and awesome packaging too).    Coming to the phone:    The phone is just awesome, great to hold and looks stunning(almost bezelless)    The highlighting feature is the camera- 21 mp is just awesome and the selfie flash is great.    The phone is filled with sensors enhancing the user experience and is very snappy and fast.    The snapdragon 808 handles everything exceptionally and has no heating issues yet.    The speakers are great(very loud) excellent for viewing videos and playing games.        
+ Best in class but some issues    First of all let me put it like in this way.     This product is best in its price range however there are couple of issues which i feel Motorola should have clarified while launch for which i am a bit annoyed.    Inbuilt memory is 16 GB BUT usable memory is 9 GB for us,which is very less if you want to install some heavy games.     The Turbo charger is non detachable which means you cannot charge this phone from any portable power bank while travelling & you have to always carry extra USB cable to charge this phone.         
+ Awesome phone. Simple and Superb    Great phone.Awesome display, lovely audio output. turbo charger is just so turbo. No Lags and no heating issue. Camera is just great.( gO mOtO)        
+ You just can't go much wrong with it.    So I received my Moto X Style on 1st Nov and had a couple of days to check it out befor writing this review.     First of all The build is Sexy and feels premium in Hand and the Rubberised textured back makes its super grippy. Its primarily a two handed device but I can get through some casual fuctionalities with one hand.     Display is crisp and awesome (Its not amoled but that's not a deal breaker for me )         
+ You won't go wrong buying this product    This is a comprehensive review of moto x style 16 gb variant    I have been using this phone from past few days and here's what i found        Display    Quad hd screen. Its sheer beauty to look at this screen.though its a downgrade from the last year super amoled display but the LCD panel is super crisp and clear. Add to this the 2k resolution you get sharper text and vibrant colors. Watching 2k videos on YouTube is a charm.        
+ One of the best Android Phones in the 20k-30k Price Range    I bought this phone during the BASD sale and got it for Rs.19299 where I exchanged my trusty Nokia Lumia 830 that I'd used for more than a year. I bought 3 Android phones (Moto G 2nd Gen, Xiaomi Mi4i and OnePlus X) which were Epic Fails in my view which wouldn't manage simple tasks without bugs.         And then after crazy analysis I finalised on this phone and Man! I love this phone.         
+ Decent Glass Protection    Package consists of 3 sets of glasses which is unnecessary. At most two would have sufficed.    Decent quality, not the best.    Makes the phone heavier.        
- to Shortage in size as not fit for moto x style    it not good as well as very short in size of scree of moto x style . so i am never suggested to purchase this product , it loss of money        
- Low Quality Product    Hi I bought this product on 8th July which was the 1st flash sale.         The phone seems to be fine and so are the features, only concern being the high SAR value. Also the Product was delivered on time.         The phone worked fine for the first 12 days. But then I noticed that the battery would drain within a few hours of charging and post that the battery just gave up.         Tried using another battery to switch the phone on and the phone works just fine.        I am surprised that Lenovo is providing such poor quality products and flipkart backing them up.        
+ Awsome Phone Bought it in first few seconds and delivered within 24 hours by flikart :)    Best phone in range of 9999 and awesome features .         Pros: Full HD Screen    Camera 13 MP with great Quality     Faster than any other phone     Long Battery life    And much more        Best phone to buy today don't miss next sell :)        
- Heating Tooo Badly    I purchased from flipkart got the product on 13 july only swipe on the cause excessively heating after checking scree temperature about 48oC . i placed return request their assistant told me submit this mobile to service centre. we are not responsible any kind of heating issue in the product . So don'T purchase this product.        
- Problem with lenovo k3    heat and draining the battery and you can feel heat while talking to phone, you can feel this in 2 min. After starting the call. I can say this is bad design because charging port is at top of the phone near to ear piece. This should be at mic        
+ Great phone at this price.    Good :         1) Great UI    2) No lags.    3) Sound quality is good.    4) Awesome display    5) Very smoothness.    6) Game performance is better than Mi4i        Bad:         Every thing Good expect rear camera.     1) Average camera quality.     2) No face detection features in rear camera.    3) Lot of pre installed apps. we can't remove it.        
+ Best Brand and Specs phone at this price    Pros:        Fantastic upgrade in terms of brand, configuration and best value for money.    Camera quality is amazing.            Cons:        Don't see any Cons after buying this phone.        
+ Awesome phone to own if you plan to by 5.5 inch    I bought this phone on 1st flash sale and following are my observartions using it for 1 days.        PROS    1. Light weight.All the persons who checked my mobile was surprised of light weight it was.Good weight distibution    2.Audio quality-Very crisp and clear with dolby audio(Tested with sennheiser CX 275 s).    3. Display: Full HD and it was Awesome experince.Tried watching HD video and it was like wow. Similar to Sony Bravia display phones .    4. Body: Good build quality for below 10000 phones.Very slim and handy.        
- Heating and battery drainage    A bad product. battery drains out very fast and heating problems.     Many people are facing the same problem and it's not going even after upgrading to latest software.        
- WORST SERVICES, HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED    OD202844757552367300 was autocancelled after reaching my nearest hub. No logical reason available with customer care.    Shall i opt for consumer court?        
- Heat problem    Hi,        If i open any applications with in 5 Min it heated to much and Internet related issue.         Regards,    Ravi        
- Very Heating    Please don't buy this product.its like a heating pad.I just started setting up the phone on first boot up the phone got heated up and it is really unbearable to use.        
- very poor display strength...very fragile..its not gorilla    hi all...    I seriously doubt that this phone has corning OGS glass...     i bought a new Mi4i few days(40-45 days) back from flipkart...    and now this mi 4i with gorilla glass got cracked by a little thumb pressure    now touch is not working....and service center told me that it cost rs 12000        phone costing 12999    display costing 12000        my overall experience and review is very bad..plz dont get trapped.. don't buy.. this cheap, fake, Chinese company product..        
- Quality issues    Issues with the phone.        1. LED leak at bottom of the screen, under the back-lit buttons.         2. Phone overheats even with brief usage on 3G/WIFI.        Have requested for return. Waiting for reply from Flipkart.            
- SOUND PROBLEM    Vibrate my tv when volume at 15 plus., and hang problem when connect my pendrive. some time not every time        
+ Worth every penny!!! My first 5 star rating in Flipkart    I bought this TV last month for 13K, using it for the last one month. Picture quality is good, no lesser than my Samsung 22 inch TV at home. Sound quality was initially was not so good, but when I change some equaliser sound preferences, it is good now. (But I connected the TV audio to my home theatre for better surround sound.)        It has 2 USB's 2 HDMI's, 1 VGI, 2 DVD In, 1 DVD our, Microphone out and also 1 Cable TV in. No other TV has these much of connections.        
- Not satisfied with the sound quality    The picture quality is nice. The tv is nice except for the sound. The TV's audio system makes irritating vibrating sound even on low volumes. I tried connecting it to external speakers. There is a high frequency noise when connecting it to external speaker. My speaker is by bose and they do not have any noise problems. The problem is coming from the TV.        
+ Good Product to buy    Hi All,        I had seen some comment about sound, But that is not true.        Picture quality and sound both are good.         Only one limitation:- you can play avi,mp4 format video through USB, if you connect your pen drive.        Thanks        
+ micromax LED tv    Packing excellent    but deliver time is not satisfactory it should be less.for change of address for demo & insatallation I have to call that sevice person 2 to 3 times .     flipkarts costmer service is excellent 8/10 for their service    @ Tv    Display good    connecting options are good    sound is little low    value for mony        
+ Best of the Lot.    Micromax and Flipkart helped me to get the best deal.    Previously i used Philips 32 LCD TV which was the best TV when i purchased but after it got repair, we decided to upgrade and finally decided for this TV.        On receiving the item we are very satisfied, the sound and Picture quality is superb.        
+ Delight    I've ordered on 18/02/16 and got delivered on 20/02/16,i've read many saying that the sound quality is not so good... But for me the Picture quality and Sound is way too good in this price range... Worth to buy..        
+ Best phone, go for it    I was confused in between Lenovo K4 note vibe, Le 1S and Honor 5x. Trusting Huewai, I ordered 5x and it was a good decision. Phone is very beautiful and nicely built. Performance is great. The UI lags sometimes, but no lags when using any app or playing games (Asphalt 8 runs super smooth). Also I had a talk with Huawei customer care and they told that EMUI 4 will be coming to this phone to make the UI more beautiful and smoother. Don't think much and just go for this phone.        
+ Wonderful product from huawei    At first I want to say Thank u flipkart.....this phone is excellent in my view....that's according to my using experience....display,hardware,software,gaming,camera and music everything is fine...only one disappointment is headphone is missing there.....so u have to buy it from Market or online...my final say is that just without wasting your time go for it....this is a masterpiece smartphone with compare to other flagship phones....Just superb Phone.......        
+ costly phone at these value    1.Heating issue in handset.    2, OTG NOT SUPPORTED.    3.NOT GOOD BACKUP,    4.FAST CHARGER NOT AVAILABLE    5.LOW LIGHT IN DISPLAY.        
+ Good phone for average users    Overall looks and performance is good for this phone at this price... you will get only 900mb internal memory..        
+ good phone    Item is having good features though battery back up is low and internal memory is also less. good music ...good camera ....good sound quality and quite easy to handle..........a nice smartphone at this price.        
- Poor camera not suggested    Camera and display is poor battery is good lags alot I purchased YU yunique much much better        
- Screen resolution is below par    The phone is all fine but not its low quality display. There could have been more pixel density in its screen to make the phone a complete gadget. Otherwise the phone is best in this price range than others.        
- Not as Featured    Touch is Average, Camera Quality is too poor & cheap, & biggest problem of RAM  but how much can you expect Within Rs. 4100/-

+ Good phone in good price    I got this phone today, it is quit good as my expectation, but i am facing some display issue like, when i lock my device it automaticaly starts blinking.    If anyone has any idea about this please help me..        
- Good for the buck paid    Nice features but very low internal memory...just 0.9 gb free...can't even run Facebook app smoothly...no otg Support...average product        
- Not suitable for those who using games    Service is 100% satisfied,but phone utter flop,because battery is not good        
- Worst product    Very poor quality.. And very bad camera.. Totally a waste of.. Money.. I bought it and crying when ever using..         
+ micro max mobiles    Slim and sound effect very low,  always  we want use  charging  compare to other  micro max canavas  its very low cost.        
+ nice phone    its an average phone , and its what u can expect in this much price , i'm satisfied with the product but what makes u happy is the snapdeal's quick delivery , i've got it in 2 days , so snapdeal is awesome , hope the product will work good and will be long lasting        
- okk    ok good low specified internal memory below expectation        
- not worth  - Bad phone    I am using this phone for last two weeks, its response is very slow, video play is absolutely pathetic... do not go for it... battery life is also bad...        
- Low memory    It was said its 4gb internal memory but hardly it has 1.5gb.        
- I am not satisfy with this phone.... after using one month my opinion this is quite good.    Some apps suddenly getting close automaticaly while using... some games like Candy crush games r not working properly campared to other fone at this range....        
- Touch screen very weak.    Touch screen is of poor quality.        
- Micromax canvas A1 android one    Sir     There are some software problems in my mobile phone. I am facing downloading problem in my mobile phone.        
- waste of money    bad phone for evereyone     when u connects with wifi then its battery backup is only 2.30 hours speaker is not hear in cloudy places     camera is not great and more as all apps sre forced stoped in 1 minutes gap        
+ Micromax Good Product when i purchased    I have purchased that mobile before 1.5 year still i have no problem in this mobile but now in this mobile compare to lot of option  you have instead of this.        
- not too good    Speed is very slow.many app are not working properly.Led light operation switch off and hang the set after few minutes. With out The use of ear phone you can not talk clearly.        
+ Not that bad    It's an avarage phone, not too bad & not  too good. One thing i did not like in it is the camera quality especially the front camera quality it's so poor that it givea me heart attack whenever  i take a selfie :'D other than that it's ok        
- micromax al    The rom is not for the basic use like storage of music pics and vedio its all 4 gb  rom is for app only.        
+ gud for low budget    average mobile for first time android user....... quad core, 1gb ram, latest android,,,,,,, overall gud for low budget.

- No SIM switching,No Gallery & File Manag    Pros:Touch is great     Cons: Battery backup is poor, speaker not too loud, installed apps are not of great use.     No SIM switching,No Gallery & File Manager        
- weak  battery    Battery backup is very low.Compared to other Android phones in this range, this phone has very poor battery backup.        
+ An Average product at this price.    I using this product from last one week. Delivery from snapdeal was as per time. Product is good.with screen guard also.    I updated to lolipop. No lags in multitasking. Screen is good.    Battery life is average, not so good. Sound is average. Camera result is just above average.    It is an average product at this price. I am a first time user of micromax. So, it will take some long time to evaluate product hardware quality        
- Not Satisfied    Price and the product is ok.    When we connect the headphone it is not working....    Call is disconnecting while speaking on phone.        Battery backup is poor.        
- worst    not battery recharge    not appstore working    sd card as fault    totally waste product        
- Very Late Delivery.    1 Seller has not the product then Sanpdeal ordered 2 seller. In this process I got late delivery.        
- a good phone, but not as convenient as expected    First snapdeal service was great. This was my first purchase from snapdeal as I've shifted away from flipkart and snapdeal didn't disappoint with packaging or delivery. Infact the product was delivered on Sunday.    Product was genuine and as per description. I had to pay Rs. 500 to the apple guy to get the system activated. He refused to give bill for that as well. Anyway, not snapdeal's fault.        
- didn't reach my satisfaction    It's good phone for business purpose        
- Delivwry partners are awwful    The looks awesome no doubt,     Dint get the screen protector with the phone though ots expensive phone disappointed.    Snapdeal should have provided screen protectors.    Delivery very bad, I receives the phone after 1 week and aftwr chasing my order with courier company.        
+ Awesome product....    I ws concerned whether to buy a costly product from snapdeal or not. Bt i got a vry good product.... And it is a genuine product. I checked first in apple self service about my phone warranty.. It displayed iPhone is not activated... After activating my phone again I checked and my warranty started from the time my phone was activated.. M happy to get iPhone in my hands.. Go for it.. The only fault i found is my phone is getting too hot while i charge or use 3g network and my phone buttons are loose. If snapdeal can help me for it.        
+ Good Product    Its my first iOs device. Nice to use it. Product is delivered on time.        
- Phone review    the voice quality is not so good as expected for iphone user...        
+ exact required product    this is good product & product what exact what i required        
- Average    delivery time is good    but overall experience is average as    i upgraded this phone from 4s    but not satisfied as much i expcted        
+ Good Product    good and safety delivery with in 3days        
- bad experience    Not working like apple devicedevice    Freezing issue twice a day        
- it can be recommended only for this price range of the provided price range    i bought this phone a month ago, first it was okay in using then after a few     days this type of a brand new  phone started to hang a  lot  for me.         i was very much disappointed with this kind of performance.         and it has 8gb of internal memory and most of the space were occupied by the system apps.        and sometimes while using the phone automatically some icons get tapped and gets hanged there and i cant cancel them.        but overall this mobile can be recommended only for the price range.        but other than that  i would probbably give only 2 stars.        
+ Infocus m370i    The screen resolution of m370i is great. Rear camera picture quality pretty good.. N front camera is the only thing is I don't like it..    Rather than the phone design and construction is the best.    Slim n light...        
- Good phone but not 4 music lover.    if u r music lovers then its not for u..as pr speaker sound and quality very poor..after 20 mint uses phone  Create heat ....    .Display quality very good    .I m not find any lags     .5k range its good.        
+ Good  Quality Phone at This Price.    this is a good quality phone at this price...The body is slim, Camera is cool, Touch is awesome, Weight is reasonable and Display is brilliant....after buying this phone i hope you would feel that you have made best use of your money....        
- Good phone    Good phone but    1.battery problem when using internet battery starts discharging     2.nano SIM2 or microSd card only one slot is provided 3.SIM1 slot separate provided    4.camera quality average        
+ nice mobile slim    Nice mobile slim    Speaker good    Battery not bad     Speed is good        
+ Infocus m370i    Battery performance is good. Touch is slow.otherwise good mobile for this amount.        
- Camera.&performance.. Is not goood...    Camera is not good  when the photo zz are zoomed it looks like blurred...    I brought it from snapdeal...    In one day the phone's  launger has been stoped....    & i reset the phone to correct it...    &its prize is not costant....    Scree is good clarity...    The phone become heat  some timezz        
- infocus m370i mobile is just ok    product is good.............but one drawback is its second sim slot that you can place ther either sim or sd card. i you place ther SD card then this is like single sim handset.User memory is also less than 4GB        delivery service in allahabad is also not upto the mark. dilveryman have to inform before reaching the destination so that they can receive item easily.        
- System bit of slower nano sim option  waste option and internal memory displaying 4gb only only 50% below product        
+ we can use a single sim with memory card or an dual sim with out memory card    it is pretty good in teerms of cost but i am not satisfactory in terms of dual sim  we can use dual sim or an sim with memory card        
- charger problem    the given charger is not working i cant able to charge my phone with the given charger and the battery is getting down fastly i cant access my phone till 6 hours also as it is switching off within 6 hrs even though i charged 100%..this is my problem and the phone is functioning superb...        
+ Its good at this budget    This phone is good at the price of 5300     U receive all the latest facilities    If u dont play high level games its owsome phone in yhat range    But some issues like dual sim.but it acceptable in that range     So overall its good facilities in that range .we can buy it        
+ I Like Good    Nice Super Low Weight Mobile        
- Hybrid sim slot is bad    Hybrid sim is not good ,only using one sim and memory card or using 2 sim otherwise could not using 2 sim 1memorycard at time...        
- average mobile    Mobile is looking very good good price with this features.but heating is main defect mobile is over heating while talking gaming etc.pls verify others about momobile heating        
- Poor Battery Performance    While iam purchasing my expectations are too high... After using the mobile my feedback is        Positve feed backs        Over All Mobile looking is good,     light weight....        Negative    Poor Battery Performance    Camera is not up to the mark    While playing games mobile is getting heat...    Accessories is not getting in the market like phone cover, tamper glass, etc.,        
- Xolo Black 1X    The product is very good with sleek design, but it fall short on camera quality. Specially the shots in the artificial lights are noisy.         Also noticed the strange limitation of device not playing mp3 files on external card as ringtone.        Overheating is also a bit concern.        
- Xolo black 1x    Good product but getting so heat  can not set our own ringtones     can not use continuously for half an hour        
- Avrage ph one and avrge camera n batry bckup foxol .    I recived it yestrdy  phone is good . with 3 gb ram . prblm is that we can't use both sim and mmry card at SME time . and other prblm is that its low btry backup n average camera . its it's not 13mp I think it's 5 mp

- good mobile but.....    there is battery problem . the phone overheat quickly . camera is not good . multitasking is problematic , the phone  system crashes many times .  only the good thing is it has 25 GB as user memory . ..................SO THINK AND BUY .        
- Xolo 1x black description    No battery backup....and camera clearity is dull...defenetly not a 13 mp camera...except that all is gud.        
+ Good it is so good    Not bad in this rates        
+ xolo black ix    all feature is well but battery is not very good        
- Average product.    It's not up to mark.        
+ battery    everything is perfect except battery............        
- good but not satisfied    Performance is good but camer quality is not good I was expected more        
+ Latest feature in less price    Battery backup not good but all feature so good        
- XOLO Black 1X 32GB    I can not use my hotmail contacts with this mobile, it only shows gmail contacts. Also it only uses nano sim cards limiting its use with my older sim.        
+ Good phone for the price    An awesome phone for android users.    Pros -memory is great, 3gb RAM and 32GB storage. Very smooth to handle.    Cons - battery is a mess. Drains out very quickly which is disappointing. I used to charge my iPhone 4 times with the power bank but this phone just once.    Good phone overall.        
- Speaker quality is worst    Comparatively basic phones also, this phone speaker is very bad. Camera also not great when we take photos in the out door.        
- Not so great    Kinda okie. Not so great. With this price, one can get better quality products in local markets. Strictly okie. Average rating.        
+ awesome    I liked the material. colour is not fading nor it is going while washing. I bought it for my son. Fitting is excellent.snapdeal is doing a good job. Reasonable price.        
+ Quality products    Smooth and good looking casual shirts .slim fit and  Good quality .I am happy with this product        
+ A good online shooing site to trust with    I have ordered two shirts both of them fitted me well. Your size chart helped me to get the perfect fitting. I am very with snapdeal. The only complaint i have which is the black shirt lose its color when soaked for washing.        
+ Junkies    Good product.....slightly different. ..finishing not that great otherwise all gud        
+ Shirt    Most fav item .... Perfect for me... Love it...        
+ Shirts    Prompt and quality delivery AS PER ORDER        
+ Good Product.    The  Producrt Is Good  In Qulity........    The coloure Of The Product Is also Good....    The Price Of The Product  Is Also Good.......    I Like Both The Shirts......        
+ Worth value    I have tried both the shirts and found them pretty good. the material is of superior quality and rich look. The cuts are exactly the same as they appear in photograph. Additionally, they are more or less like slim fit.        
+ good fit    nice at the price.    but buttons on the black one are not white as depicted but black.        
+ average    Overall phone is good but battery backup is pathetic        
- not upto Google product standard    Average phone...some times show force close...but good at this price...        
+ handling was very good    It was good. But its take so much of time to upgrade to lollipop version. In this phone only one sim can use for internet not in both sim.apart from this everything is good.        
- not bad    No file manager. Little bit of flash problem.        
- don't take this product    It is very bad mobile with no battery backup battery remains only 2 hour after full charging        
- Minus point is that u can't save numbers in sim card and there is no default gallery in phone, rest all is good.  Camera is nice        
+ Micromax A1 Review    I have ordered fist time in sneapdeal, product delivered in good condition & agreed time limit.        Snapdeal service is good.        
- The over rated    The worst phone I have ever had in my life.     Its Applications are not working properly, mainly Playstore is not working and sometimes it is going to hanged for sometime        I feel, if you want to buy a phone of Rs. 6000-7000 then Lumia 530 could be a better choice        
- very poor phone    This phone has a serious problem of network. It receives only 20? of a cellular network.        
- micromax canvus A1 phone so no good    Respect sir/madam            I have purchased  micromax canvas A1 with android one from snap deal online service but  this phone battery life so no good and backup no more ten hours .so I  don't like this phone        
+ Great phone in this price ..    master piece .. battery backup , speaker, display is good .. at last i am happy to buy this smartphone from snapdeal.. love the mobile ...    
+ .first of all if u consider the price. This is worth a buy.    Bought this phone for my wife.    Specs of this phone are good at 6k, so dont exepct a nexus like xperiance.        
+ Best phone with low budget with more specifications..    Camer,battery backup is good.        
- Worthless. Not good enough. No streaming miracast.        
+ This is a very good phone with good specifications.        
- Waste of money. Camera sucks. There are much better phones at lower prices in the market.        
- Battery problem. Not worth the money.        
- Very expensive. Lagging after installing games. Screen easily breaks.        
- The Company is Not launching any good phone now. Not recommended at all.        
+ The service of Xiaomi in India is not that much good as all other big brands but still they are doing their level best to give best. I have bought all Xiaomi India products and none of them required to visit a service center to date.        
- The apps cannot be moved to memory card so you have to use the only 11 gb space available in phone for apps (half will be consumed by whats app)        
+ excellent one at good price for common people.        
- Heating issue and battery back is so poor.        
+ It is a awesome phone at this price with full of good specification.        
+ Very nice mobile phone. Good performance.        
- This phone have an issue while you get a call or if you received any calls, if I talk, other side cont able to listen properly because the talking speaker is below the phone. This make an issue while we talk.        
- Net speed is very slow, you tube also very slow, I m nt much satisfied with this cell.        
+ Great Device , worth for money.        
+ Its 3000 mah battery and battery backup is really impressive and even the charge timing.... It charges from 5% to 100% in 1hour and 40 minutes.        
- Display sensor sometimes not working.        
+ Awesome phone......    Great battery life, awesome camera, good build, fast processor, 3GB RAM, 16GB ROM, and a perfect gaming phone..        
- The accessories are of dump quality..the charger adapter stopped working in 2nd month..the earphone stopped working on the 10th day.        
+ 3gb ram is awesome.Front came is awesome.. Good battery backup. I liked it.        
+ Superb...... All is well about it.        
+ This mobile deserves appreciation. Want to know why, lets find out.    I have been using this phone for 2 months now thanks to my office they gave me this as my daily driver. It is one of the best in it's price segment.        
- junk mobile... charger port gone bad within 5 months ... Better don't buy this mobile.        
+ I love it very nice mobile    I like it        
- worse phone.    in two month battery backup is poor and heating my mobile.        
+ Excellent product..delivered as expected..    Contains every feature it claims and more..        
- Battery is not that much good, dried out soon.        
+ It's an amazing smartphone with customised ROM..        
- phone is ok . but after sale service is very poor.After four months of usage , white lines appeared on screen        
+ Its one of the best mobile in budget range.        
- No head phones received with the phone. Bad phone.        
+ it is excellent handset , it is according to my needed        
+ I bought it for my brother. He is happy with the phone. I didn't heard any complaints till now. Budget phone. It is good for beginners.        
+ Im using this mobile since from 4 months and experience is awesome.. no lagging, excellent audio and video quality when compared to other mobile phones under this segment.        
+ One of the best phone Lenovo did a great job with this one.    Pros include 1) Excellent phone by Lenovo in budget price. 2) No hang problems occurred.        
+ The most remarkable feature about the phone is the front camera and it's image clarity. This comes with a software which enhances the face beauty. Suits very well for selfie lovers.        
+ Very good mobile for me. How I use. Fast and furious.Processing speed is very fast.All apps running smoothly. Screen resolution so good. Brighten and Natural color. Front camera clarity is wow.        
- The phone has more cons than it has pros.    pros: decent looks, affordable    Cons: poor UI    battery drains very fast    slow operations        
+ The phone is a masterpiece.I used Samsung ,Microsoft lumia but this is the best at the price of 7999.        
- Very bad, Not at all happy about this product.        
+ Good phone with zero issues.        
- Camera quality is average, battery require long time to charge and battery back up is average.        
+ Phone is very nice to use. Good battery backup!!        
+ It is value for money.    Pros:    1) Product design is very slim and it's a light weight    2) The camera is good if you are a selfie king or queen I guess you can have this phone.        
- Average Performance. Surprisingly, inspite of the specs I wasn't very impressed. No Gorilla Glass.        
+ Phone is good in this price. Camera clarity also fine. Sound system amazing.        
- I have been using this phone for almost a year now, and I can assure you that no matter what the specs say, or how attractive it looks for its price range, you will regret buying it for the rest of your life, it will simply make your life a living hell ! It worked fine for the first 3-4 months but then it started showing its true colors.        
+ Excellent working condition. Superb. Totally worth it. I love this phone.        
- Not even worth half its price. Camera is so bad.        
- I hate the fact i spent money on this phone.        
+ wow. just awesome. This phone is the best one i have ever used.        
+ Not a bad thing to say about this phone. simply one of the best.        
- Worst phone i've ever bought, didn't get switched on after a month, gave it 2 the service centre and i'm getting the worst possible reply, waiting for over ten days 2 get a reply.        
+ Product is good. Fast and smooth operation.    Camera not that good in low light. Gainy pictures in rooms        
+ Battery lasts a day with moderately heavy use. Screen is nice. Updated with marshmallow o.s. . no heating problem.        
- Heating problem. Cant play games for more than an hour.        
+ Best phone in its range. Truly good.        
- Terrible phone. Money is wasted.        
- Got a faulty product..one sim slot not working properly..its always showing no sim..very problematic.        
+ 1: The camera is good, if you are a selfie king or queen I guess you can have this phone.    2: You can have this phone if you want a phone for gaming purpose.Great gaming experience, play almost all games without having any lagging problem.        
+ Excellent.... Phone in this price ...battery is very powerful...camera is better than everage.        
- Guys new os update will make your life hell it lagging n unable to open phone book messages what's app application & music automatically shutdown        
+ It is value for money. I have got it yesterday and i have noted few things of this phone    1.product design is very slim and it's a light weight    2.it has very good quality battery. Battery gets charged early and it lasts for long hours.        
- The touch screen was not working properly after 15 days of the delivery. encountered many problems and still roaming back and forth to service centers..Frustated.        
- I Request everyone not to buy this product three months back when I am using my mobile suddenly shutdown when am trying to switch on display is not working.        
+ 1. Smooth Touch Pad.    2. Good Battery life if you use it without the use of net. It stays for two days maximum without charging.    3. Decent camera. The 8 MP rear camera is good, though you can't expect a HiFi cam at this price. The 2 MP front camera is okay for selfies.        
- This is one of the worst product I have ever seen. After one week of purchase it not working properly.        
+ On time, very simple to operate, very elegant in look-n-feel and google talk is the best of all!        
+ I am writing this after a week of using it. Worth the money. Lenovo is a very good product compared to its other Chinese competition. Very quick and have loads of features. My other phone is iPhone 6, Lenovo A6000 is comparable to it for the speed, camera and quality of its OS. Obviously, the build quality is for the price of INR 6500.        
- Its just a OK product and doesn't have a feel good factor. Except for the display all aspects of this phone are mediocre. After lollipop update everything went for a toss. After a reset things are better, but the phone freezes frequently. I never had these issues with my 1st gen moto e. Also the phone is very light and flimsy.        
- Horrible product. Didn't work after first charge. Took it to he service centre and they said it is a battery issue. Didn't work again. They asked me to take it to another service centre who said that the motherboard is faulty and repaired it. Still did not work!        
- I will suggest all the people who is expected to buy, the lenovo, phone is worthless.        
+ Hats off to amazon. I got the phone delivered to my remote town in just 7-8 days. It was a gift to my parents.    About the phone: The best phone in this range. Very handy and classy look. Battery backup is far better than other phones. Both primary and secondary cameras are awesome.        
- The phone worked fine for 10 days and started giving problems. Call gets disconnected, phone gets hanged, try to dial one number from contacts and some other number gets dialled. I bought this as a gift to my sister-in-law and I feel really bad for gifting such a bad phone.        
- The phone gets heated very fast. The Google recommendation was to unmout the SD card when phone is not in use. As per recommendation we unmounted the SD card. Now we are unable to view the files in the SDcard. Pls suggest way to view and use the files.        
- The phone is not upto the expectations. The apps. are running slow. Hanging sometimes. Irritating at times phone is urgent by hanging or switchoff automatically. I have expected lot from Lenovo. But it is not.        
+ The phone is very good. The sound system and the 4G internet connection is worth using. The best value for money in that range.    The battery life can be improved upon. The built in memory also had to be more, but we can increase by the SD card.        
+ Friends this is my genuine review.This is the best phone in this range.Its configurations are powerful.Nice camera and soundclarity.Its screen is good and nice,but the headset coming with this phone is pathetic...Overall it is a good Phone        
-Worst mobile    Poor performance    hanging    Contacts not display immediately and when we use Internet it doesn't response for incoming calls    Launcher loading poor        
+ Good sound effects    Best battery backup    Very good mobile    Best filp cover for cool mango brand don't buy other        
- Worst phone ever used...Lenovo is not reliable at all when it comes to mobile phones...worst performance..phone hangs too often(literally every minute), gets slow within a month of purchase...and it happens with ever Lenovo phones.        
- Worst ever phone i bought in my life , hanging like anything , display prob , battery doesnt stand half day , hear phone sucks    
- Not a wow factor    Call drop and network issue are common with limited space        
+ Awesome phone in this price range ...    This is my first android device and I had a thrill in using this device. Good job in making this masterpiece.        
+ Good smart phone in starting    This was my first smart phone,which I have purchased after a lot online research.Delivery was good.Phone is good for those who are purchasing smart phone first time.Features are good.But camera is not so good and pictures are not too clear.        
+ GOOD BUDGET FONE.    I took and using this phone since last 2 months,(previously I used the great windows os phone). now am sharing the usage experience:    Performance/Speed : EXCELLENT    Look: Average,    Display: Average (for this to remember us that this is budget phone) I am facing a problem that the resolution/pixel of photo seen in gallery is poor but the same photo is good quality as well in the related app. For ex if you see the photo (taken by camera ) in gallery is very poor quality the same photo is very good if u seen in camera app.    Battery : Average you can use all apps in average usage up to 18-20hours in a day.    Touch: is average compared to gorilla glass display need more updates ...    thanks.        
- battry is very bad    all is ok but battry is very bad        
- not installing any apps        
- Simply waste    Don't buy product from snapdeal        
- Snapdeal screws up yet again!!    Well! What do I say. My initial order was cancelled and the new order took over 2 weeks to deliver. It was supposed to be a gift for someone. The only reason I chose snapdeal was because of the price. Order was placed on the 1st and the phone was delivered on 18th May. Now comes the best part. The Phone Conked Off exactly a week after delivery. Can you believe that. My friend called me today morning (26/05/15) saying the phone wouldn't switch on. And now I gotta go run around. Find a Micromax service centre and try to get this thing fixed. Dang!  This has taught me a very valuable lesson. Never buy stuff from Snapdeal ever again. I've lost faith in them altogether.        
+ good phone for rough use.    got for ma bro!!     data cable connected to the adapter was not working    phone hardware specifications are pretty good wherein the software of the phone is the same ,after updating u may face some issues ,refer google,it may help u with that,taking to the store or planning to return will b quite challenging as u vl end in paying more or local tech may remove some parts with duplicate.        
+ Average, Ordinary    Micromax Canvas A1 is very good mobile in this range. i can say on the whole it is outstanding except battery backup.        
- Don't judge a book by its cover"    Take more charging time [Approximate 5-6 hours for fully charging the mobile]... & gets battery down in 5-6 hours in stand by mode.        
- Average, Ordinary    Phone futures everything is ok display also very nice but battery only quickly decrees    i need request more battery developed this phone.        
+ Average performance    This is average performance mobile. Camera quality is normal.    Overall "OK" but not value for the money.        
+ Best phone    Best phone and the services by snapdeal is the best. They delivered before time.        
- micromax    phone is good but service was bad . it took 1 month to deliver        
- Packaging was pathetic    The phone is awesome no wonder but the packaging was pathetic. The iPhone box was just kept inside a Snapdeal cardboard box that's it. I wonder how it came safely from Delhi.        
+ Gr8 deal    The phone is perfect... But the delivery issues are always there for snapdeal.        
- Budget phone but not very smart. File manager is not available in the phone but yet nice. For international users it's good all the way it's normally awesome mobile phone which I experiance

+ In focus m370i    It's nice but sim card an memory card not worked at the same time        
- Infocus m370i found average due to some unavailable fac    Over all OK but there should have been provision dual sim and Sd card also so that gallery items could have been stored there to save phone memory.

+ average mobile    i just experienced the led flash problem but the rest is good        
- Infocus M370i    Along with this product need to sell the accessories its better .till I am searching the back cover and tempered glass.        
+ Good phone in best price    Very good looking and fast performance by infocus and best service by snapdeal thanks snapdeal        
- Infocus m370i    Infocus m370i mobile is very very slow. So pls don't buy this mob.        
- Not Satisfied    It has second sim slot which could be used either for nano Sim  or for SD card.    this is hidden in description.        
+ Overall performance is just good not better or best    This phone is slow with a 1.1 GHz processor and heat up after using 1 hour or More        
- AFTER A USE OF 15 DAYS    Getting irritated with this device it is getting strucked and we cant use two SIMs and SD cardcard at a time        
- my mobile is nice but not perfect    Some time is very slowly

- Bad Product    not so good quality        
+ Good Product    It's good mobile phone but one problem is SD card and Sim 2 is one space        
- Its ok type mobile    Being wise the display is good. Nice HD display camera is not good mobile lags a lot good thing is have 4g..u would say its a average mobile.. Think before you buy        
- Bad Product    Camera not so good & touch is not responding some time so guys don't buy it        
+ Good Product    nice camera pic from a front camera to take a selfie best        
+ its only single sim phone.    phone looks ok. but we can insert one sim only.     if we use memory card, then we must remove 2nd sim.    bcz 2nd sim slot is memory/sim slot        
- phone is ok    Features are good.    But constrains are:    1. If u have to use 2sims, you can't use memory card.    2. Very low ringer volume     Very bad        
- Bad Product    very worst        
+ Infocus m370i    The phone getting overheated when we using continuously a hour but for the price the camera quality and performance is good        
+ According to price It's fine    Hang issue, and very expensive accessories. If your display has been broke down and you want to change the display then you have to pay approx 3000 to 4000 for a single display.        
+ Good Product    it's not the same, that's on the snap deal, design something different.        
- Bad Product    this iw good tb so so in didnt able tu use sim 2 nd mamory card at same time. camera is also not good i am not happy with this        
- Bad Product    handset its good but voice is not so good        
- Bad Product    hang problem but function is good..         
- Bad Product    picture quality is good and other things are also gud bt m giving only 2stars bcz the warranty card is not given in the box. Plz give mee some info about the warranty of this cell        
- avoid it because ram is too low    ram is very low...        
+ Good product    Overall experience of this mobile is quite good. Camera & performance is not soo good. If you want a good mobile for average use,go for it.        
- Missing inbuilt facility    product is likely good but you have not given earphone/head phone even FM redio is supported with head phone. It is not good procedure for sell.        
- Batteries is quick discharge in 4 to 5 hours of normal usage.    The Phone is pretty good, but the battery capacity is very low it( requires3000Mah) I have seen that data enabling between SIM & Phone is so late        
- Not worth.  the specification is well but is not up to their mark    Average mobile it is not worth        
- Xolo black 1x Review    This phone is good by memory. Display. Gaming. Sound But Very bad on Camera quality 13 and 5 MP its jock worst quality of photo .    If u want a phone with good camera plz don't go for it        
+ Good one for ur money    Good one, But some times display will get automatically turn off. thats the only fault, even camera ok only, not so gud, but shutter timing is really gud        
- Average phone..    Look good..but compare to lenovo k3 note it is very average..        
- Xolo black 1x 32gb    Its a good item, but it has a few disadvantages 1. USB drivers for PC should be auto loaded. 2. Sharing PC internet feature should be added.        
- Xolo black 1x a average performance phone    Sleek design, wt less.    Battery with stand for 18 to 20hrs/day    Camera performance avg    Phone is getting heat while using net and also while using speakers.    Speakers performance too poor        
- camera is not so good    instead from the  camera. other functions of this mobile are good,        
+ Looks nice .....    I just order now       So will see  how is it i hope     Everything is good ...        
+ Good xolo black 1x    Good performance camera and all phone performance is very good..        
- Ok average phone    OK not so great as thought    Branded phones are better     Like Samsung        
- Naveen kumar    Camera and heating problem        
+ Nice phone    Nice phone in this price range        
+ Processer is too fast which is the unique point    Should buy this is the good pirce with more features        
+ Phone overall avearage    Phone camera is bad. Battery is ok    No hanging problem    Touch is super        
+ pinakin modi    Good mobile.used last 1week.back cover is not available.        
+ mobile xolo black 1x    the mobile ws very nice but one problem the battery power very fast discharge        
- Average performance    Though a good buy at the cost but still many features are over promised but do not deliver performance as promised. Like the camera, then phone cannot be connected to other devices like a PC or a laptop.        Also the display for apps is not attractive. And touch also not that good...    Still all in all a good budget buy..        
- Low Battery Performance    The battery doesnt stand even a single day of 8 Hours in office, with the given features of 4g Connectivity, 3GB Ram and others.....But please give a battery which is capable enough to handle all these features.......        
- Average phone    Good phone but poor Camera Quality and battery        
- unsatisfied with memory /sim card slot    unsatisfied with slot system otherwise nice product        
+ Good Product    best cell this amount        
+ Snapdeal's vision is to create India's most impactful digital commerce ecosystem that creates life-c    i like this phone..............        
- I have bought this mobile 2  days ago    Sir , I bought this mobile and used it for not more than 2 days because it has a very bad Camera quality and it is getting overheated,    When using games, internet, etc.    Battery backup is not so good .    Only look wise and memory wise it is good     So plz.  Think before you buy it and read My review  for this Mobile.    This is my worst every mistake done only by seeing the ram and the memory.        
- Puspendra patel    Product is good sometimes it get heated and hanged        
- Average performer. Not value for money Phone    The Camera and the battery back up is very poor and it heats up a lot while playing games. Average performer phone.        
+ Nice phone .good features    Good mobile with nice feature.good touch.weightless.camera is ok.works as normal mobile.no hanging        
+ Only Battery Issue Nothing Else    Its An amazing Phone There is only One Problem That is Only Issue is battery

There is a torch also.    Only issue is - they do not have speed dial. Otherwise everything, I found is good.

+ GOOD PRODUCT................    GOOD PRODUCT................Nicely Work ....Very Good Function Low Budget...        
- Nice but loops aren't impressive    Better to go for bsnl phones.        
+ Super mobile    Nice phone, good price        
+ I Kall K 11 Blue Blue    GOOD SELLER,GOOD PRODUCT.        
+ Good One for call only purpose!    Truths:-    It's a good phone with almost the basic features like Calling, call recording, blacklisting,diverts,sms,mms,calculator,fm radio,camera,card slot.        Lie:-    Battery is NOT 1000mAh. It is may be 400 or 500 mAh but definitely not 1000mAh and lasts for only 1 day whether used or unused. Luckily I had 1 BL-5C battery from my previous phone that is 1020mAh and it is working fine with this phone with a backup of 4-5days.        Cons:-    No vibration mode.    only three ringtones.    Not Loud enough so as to be heard during travelling or outside.        Conclusion:-    All in all its an average phone but its ok because what to expect from a 500 Rupee phone. In this price range its a best buy.        
+ George ignatius    weightless mobile and mobile look is very nice        
+ Honest Review    Really a nice phone. good features for this price, Loud ringtone, good voice clarity, good data speed, good picture . Above all stable hardware wise,....     I'm loving it.        cons are no headphone,battery only 2070mAH 2500mah could be better

+ Perfect smartphone    This phone is very impressive. Highlights are    Perfect looks - full point    5" screen . very easy to hand    very good performance    Zen UI has some very good feature which are identical to MOTO G or One plus X    Excellent camera

- Very bad phone.    The phone is not at all good. Very poor battery performance. The charger is not working. Also the basic features for which I bought this low cost phone are also not good. Ex. The phone log doesnt show the call times in case of multiple calls, only last call time is displayed. The keypad is difficult to type. The dialer does not search from contact list on the basis of first few digits. I regret buying this phone on basis of samsung brandname. Would recommend folks to go for Nokia for feature phones.        
+ as per price of this product it is good    The phone has fulfill all basic functionality.    But it is little bit small phone as compare to others    But performance n functionality wise its overall good        
+ product feed back    best price,better product,good quality and less weight        
- Needs That Special Something    Since i purchased this item ,battery seems not good.    battery got drained in 10 hr even if i am not using at all.

- phone feels plasticky    Phone quality doesn't feel good. It's plastically and make all sorts of plastic noise while using.        
- Dont judge by a look    I have Samsung Guru Music 2 Duos from Snapdeal but i think the product is defected beacuse since I got the phone keypad of the phone is not working good.Because of keypad i am facing many problems.            
- poor quality product    I am not satisfied with the product which I got.    But delivery of product is prompt        
+ i got good product    its very nice one, i got very low price from snapdeal, but the delivery took very long        
- Phone stopped working just after 10 days.    Phone stopped working just after 10 days. Terrifying customer experience. Lost faith over Snapdeal retailer base.        
- Not so Good    Hi     This should have Play store. There is no Play store     Due to i unbale to download the latest games. apps etc.        Other wise touch. battery backup everything is good.        But only they have to provide Play store.    I didnt happy with this.

+ Easygoing    It is a Good phone ..    Pros:  It has Nice clarity .. Samsung is Extremely budget friendly . It is an ideal gift as it is good and affordable. It already has a few apps . The touch screen is very smooth and easy to use. I am very happy with the device . It is a great smartphone . The headphones clarity is also amazing and clear and loud. If u want to give ur parents a phone this is it. Because parents need it for calling or messaging and for good pictures which this phone has     Cons : battery life is not good but then that's the case in most of the smart phones.        
+ Value for money, decent performance    For this price, the performance and quality of the product is very good. Responsiveness of the device is good. Decent display quality and battery. Good for someone who is new to smartphone world. Only disadvantage is that number and variety of apps is not as great as android. Still long way to go.

+ amazing specs in this price range.    This is my second s3 review-Internal storage is enough to keep most of apps,best touch screen,Good camera,ram is also enough to play any bulky android games and high screen resolution of 306 ppi.    Lags due to less battery 2100mah,heating problem which is not good for mother board.        
- IRLED Not vailable, poor mic & speaker quality    just 3 days before i buy..    IR-LED facility is not vailable in this product.    call mic & speaker quality is very poor.

+ avg    battery quality poor other wise very good        
- Slower    Phone lacks for every application        
+ In comparison to price, you can not expect more than this.    Though 2 GB Ram, product is not that fast. Screen contrast is average, OS Lollipop may be not suitable for this product. Google Play does not appear in Menu though shown as installed. Camera is poor. Get up is average. Net Speed is OK. Touch sensitivity is good.        
- The phone is Average Good.    Some times Non-Removable battery creates problem and there is a short delay in lighting display during incoming calls.        
- Internal memory is lower and screen is not looking in this phone color is bad look...............................        
+ micromax    product is good in cheep rate with 2 GB RAM and 8 GB internal memory . overall phone is OK.        
- Good, but not as expected    This phone got 2GB RAM, but behaving like 1GB or less. Little issue with back button, some time it is hanging. camera is ok. Bought this for the expectation of good HW configutaion. But not as expected.        
+ All the features of Micromex Juice 2 is good with 2gb RAM, HD Display and battery capacity(mAh) with 3000. But coming to Audio quality is not so good, it normal.    Over all in this cost this is will & Good.:)

+ NIce with low price    Nice mobile in low price    I like this mobile,but battery & camera is not upto marks,i am very upset from this,i recommend it to purchase this because not much problem arised        
- not  a good phone    Poor connectivity issues. Most of the time call drops. Check with mobile connectivity operator. There is no problems on connectivity with on other phones. But this phone is poor connectivity issues...not recommended to purchase rather I am thinking that f replacing the phone with snapdeal        
+ Micromax Canvas juice 2    product is good, with great camera feature & 2 GB RAM , look is also nice, but the phone is little bit heavy,because of its 3000mah battery..    overall , the product is good ..        
+ Not bad but good phone    1080p video.not supported and Mobile 2GB RAM GOOD BUT 720p video slowly run & 3000mAh battery good..

+ Product as expected from Micromax    Don't raise your hopes for this phone. Its OK Ok product. Nothing too exciting. Somewhat satisfied experience of Android Lollipop.     Average android experience. Sometimes very laggy............        
- Micromax    Some time phone automatic shutdown or sleep mode .And it will start after couple of hours .        This is only problem am facing     And other feature working nice and properly.like GPRS,Downloadng,Voice Clarity    In this i have like very much is speed of net in wrost network location    Very good phone in normal with lot of feature

+ value for money    pros:battery performance is good    phone look is good        cons:touch is not smooth    menu and application window is not trendy    no separte option to switch on gps        
- Micromax not good    call clarity is not good opposite side...signal always getting poor comparing previous mobile which i used..mobile purpose calling, but its not good.

+ good product with decent feature    i brought this mobile for my parent.    it was white as expected.    deliver time good.    packing was great.    pros:    its look is very good.    good to hold.    5mp rare camera good images are capture.    1.2 quad core.    ram is 786mb out of which about 400mb free on first boot.    4gb internal out of which 1.67gb for user    android kitkat.    pricing is descent though in someother site its much loo.        
+ perfect    This is my first android device and I had a thrill in using this device. Good job in making this masterpiece.    Pros: Touch is great, nice looks, very fast and no lags, headphone provided is great, very nice display, clear and crisp    Cons: Battery backup is poor, speaker not too loud, installed apps are not of great use, quite heavy (personal opinion)    Overall: I am happy with the device and I think it is a great smartphone and people should really buy it rather than buying a high end smartphone like Samsung or some others which offer similar features for high prices. If you are on minimal budget 10k - 15k then go for this. If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you from opting for other brands.    By navraj from asr

- Incomplete accessories    I purchased it recently. Surprised that, there is No Charger, No Head phone, in that sealed package. After that I realized that there is no mention regarding the both in its specification as well. But how can one imagine a mobile with no charger. Its simply a cheating, showing low price.        
+ best this    This is my first android device and I had a thrill in using this device. Good job in making this mobile.        
- Micromax    It is slow process network is not fast it working on like 2g network i reacharge 3g data but it work on like 2g                
+ Excelent company    Good mobile  two giga byte rendom access memory.camera is very sharp result

- sudden hanging problems occur.    This phone is good but not our expectation.        
- false price tag    Mobile is good but the offer they give is not true in discount        
- Complain    Good mobile but its battery is not removable and in its battery specification available on net differ with battery supplied with mobile set. as per net its battery is li-ion but battery supplied with hand set is li-poly which not under stood?

+ Average Phone in this price range    battary backup is good    sound quality is average    camera is average    look is good    features are average    overall value for money        
- Very poor camera quality. High on specifications only    Don't buy this product if you are looking for a good camera.        
- Charging problem    It almost takes 4 to 5 hours to be full charged    If you disconnect the charger in 3 hours. It is charged only 50 to 60 %. Worst for the charging prospectus        
- Very Bad Phone    I bought this phone with huge expectation because my grand 2 was not able to give proper battery backup. I thought this phone with 2100 mah battery will do good because unite 3 hai less function. From day 1 battery getting drained 1% per two minute        
- Unite3    The product u r sending is not giving warranty in latur.        
+ Average, Ordinary    The product is great ..but about snapdeal service and app --there is no way to get expected delivery date in snapdeal app..you will left wondering when dispatch date is same as delivery date and not the case..overall not good experience buying products on snapdeal but its average.        
- Very Dispointing from snapdeal    i bought this mobile 5 days ago , but the charger is not working at all.    I am very disappointed from the service of snapdeal.        
+ Three Stars..!    Good for moderate use..        pros-    1. android 4.4.2 with touchwiz out of the box    2. expandable memory upto 64gb    3. dual sim        cons-    1. low resolution screen(480 x 800 pixels)    2. low inbuilt memory(4gb)    3. average battery(2000 mAH)    4. average camera    5. low resolution video recording in camera, i.e. 640x480        
- Not a pure smartphone    Good Phone...  but  this is not a pure smart phone... sensor not available... otg not supported.  screen resolution poor... sound quality also poor.... Camera pic quality good...        
- Average samsung phone    If You use the Phone memory of this phone ,Phone will be hang too much and also camera is not good.so in this price of the samsung phone average .....I am recommend this phone on the customer mind that purchase or not        
+ Average, Ordinary    Mobile is good, Delivery is good, But some application like facebook,Whats App, location in Phone memory for Permanet, Which is not good,Phone getting Slow, Courier is Asking Extra shipping Charge in Free Delivery,        
- Mobile is very hanging and duplicate        
+ Micromax unite 3    Awesome product...awesome online service.....awesome phone in this price        
+ Worth of money    Worth of money,Till now All looks good.Even its delivered with in the timelines.        
+ Manglore    Ya this good service, otherwise we go shop seeing so many phones here means we choose in home only and select, nw we r working so we have no time keep it, this is good go head.        
+ in this price it is the best    Average        
+ Micromax X088... Should You Buy or Not !!    A value for money for those who are interested in nothing except utilizing the phone for calling and texting.. But can prove a loss for those parents who are going to had this to their little children as most of the games and apps in the phone deduct money from the talktime..    Plus points:Dual sim, 1.3MP Camera(is a great feature at a low price like this), FM Radio, GPRS and clear audio speakers..    Negative points: There is no internal memory... You need to have a memory card for everything.. Battery life is quiet low and nevertheless the phone has some apps which can deduct your talktime to upto 50 rupees..    Thats all about my review... i would recommend this phone to those who need it just for calling nd texting purpose...        
- bad for hearing    I would not suggest anyone to buy it. there is a cost that you are going to be paying for it's cheap price, that's headache. the sound that's coming out of the phone is so loud and nauseating, my head started to pain. I would suggest to go for same range samsung or nokia phones. there is a reason micromax sells this cheap phone.        
+ Decent for the price    Nice product from a mid sized OEM. A decent enough product to suit elders. Could have been better in plastic quality, would suggest you guys to compare with Nokias and Samsungs before buying as they have better models that are priced slightly higher than this. Otherwise a good buy.        
- micromax    one week back I have purchased the mobile but is not good. Battery back is not good        
- average    Phone display is not clear in visually...that is not good manufacturing. will struggle for woking.        
- Snapdeal price is best    Good product,but micromax is not focussing on QC.I received defective charger inside the packet.        
+ Nice product    Good Product but keypad is very hard... but useful for long talks...        
- Dont Buy This    The handset is very bad cheap plastic used, vibrates without the vibrate mode. Very disappointed and will never go for MMX again.        
- okkkkk    good product at this price but the cord is not good. the headset is having only 1 ear cord . the charger cord is very short. the processor is very slow and not suitable for wap. on an average product        
- DON'T BUY    I THINK IT IS WASTE PRODUCT FROM MICROMAX        
+ Good Product Cheap Rate    Product is good but it's springy .. Vibrated much ..        
- working is not good    I have purchased it on 25Oct2013 but it has stopped working two times just in a week.        
- Not good    operating is very slow n poor technology not user friendly        
+ Ok for the price    The phone is functional, ok for the price and received very fast. Person I bought it for just started using it so will see in a few months how it works.        
- Price is over    Wap memory full show after switch off phone and on connect internet        
- Need more    I want a mix of laptop where I can work on docs ppts save pics and connect hard drives. Apple by not giving these options is limiting its product use. Am unable take a wifi back up except at airport, and Apple should have even internet on phone as back up option. Apple pls make globally usable products.        
+ Good product    The product is good, but it took 2 weeks to get it shipped and delivered. Snapdeal delivery/shipping is pathetic, wrong estimated delivery dates etc.        
+ Overall it's a great product.    I have been using this product since 1 week.     I'm completely satisfied with features camera, net browsing, music, display, performance, battery life, reading files.     The only thing disappointed me is there is no whatsapp messenger and viber  in apps store.     When I received the delivery my iPad Air has operating system IOS 8.0.2 and I was facing problem of auto rebooting in the middle of using, after upgrading to latest IOS 8.3 the problem is solved.    The out speaker volume is a bit low.        
+ Would recommend this product.    Picture quality with the 5mp camera is bad compared to regular mobile phones. Not as claimed by apple. Disappointed with the rear camera.        
+ Apple's Best Product Forever    AWesome TAblet with apple support n Best FOREVER        
+ Good Service    The product was delivered on time but they did not allow me to check the product before delivery.        My Ipad Air 128 gb wi-fi + cellular is working in good condition.        This is my first product purchase from Apple family.        Good gadget at affordable prices.        
+ Lenovo Tab 2 A7-10 8GB Wifi Tablet    decent tab at this price range.gud for gaming & watching movies        
- not satisfied    This tab does not  play HD movies(size 1.2gb) properly.    Hanging problem.    Don't buy this product        
- this tab is hanging problem    not good tablet it's very hanging problem. not respons snapdeal team.        
- So So Product    Poor WiFi, disconnets autometiclly while other gudgets remain connected. it sucks when u play online games. No inbuilt music palyer. u have to use google play music. go for 3G tabs instead of this one. Camera is also of no use, capatures reversed image        
+ simple tab for first time users    am using this for  videos and e-books.. ok its better in this prize.value for money.        
+ Lenovo Tab 2 A7-10 Tablet    Product is good also delivery is very fast. But I like to have invoice soft copy for warranty purpose        
+ value of money    Mid range tablet. Display is good, ram speed good. Light weight good looking. not finger print friendly. Decent battery backup. Slightly dissapointing is ebook reading. In PDF apps text rendering is slow. Ansoid kitkat seems decent. Overall less than 5k tablet is worth a buy but have to overlook a few cons. By the way tablet has a excellent audio output via Dolby system.        
+ tab is good    WiFi issue exists. Otherwise the tab is good. It would be nice to have 3g calling facility.        
+ Average, Ordinary    good tablet for gamers and screen brightnes is low in outdoors we have to glare up into the screen then it is visible,and stucks some times     over all good tablet in this price range        
- Wifi & heating problem    Wifi is not connecting from next room. I have Samsung phone & Lava phone. They are connecting to wifi from next room of the router, but this tablet is giving problem.        This table is getting some hot on back-upper side for light use also. So, I am holding this tablet the other side only while playing games.        
+ Best tablet in this price    this is best tablet at this price good quality and battery totally better for this price of branded tablet no one cannot gives these features
